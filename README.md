# Leaf-Image-Classifier
Plant Species Classification using leaf images with CNN
# Description:
The objective is to use leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify the species. The goal is to build a model/classifier that uses the pre- extracted features and train neural network for classification of leaf images. Finally, examine the errors and improve the accuracy.
# Dependencies:
Data source: A leaf dataset
Link for dataset download: http://leafsnap.com/static/dataset/leafsnap-dataset.tar
System Requirements:
You need to have following software on your computer to run the project file.
1. Python 3.0
2. TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy packages
3. Anaconda Navigator 4. Jupyter Notebook
OR
You can download the dataset and upload the file along with dataset on Google Colab and run directly. https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
